It can be inferred then, that I expended work to gather these images, and thus they are provably “collected”.\nThe protocol is infinitely flexible. These NFTs can be sent using almost any protocol (TCP/IP, SMTP, SMS, Nostr, etc), using any client you wish. Moreover, you can send them to whoever you want, whenever you want. It’s an entirely censorship resistant system, and no one can ever take them away from you.\nIn fact, you can also turn these NFTs into a physical bearer instrument by putting them on a USB drive!\nAll in all, I think these are way more doper than existing NFTs.\nPlus, you can have them for free, my treat!"
